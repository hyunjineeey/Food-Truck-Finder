# Food Truck Finder

## Overview

The goal of this is to write a simple command-line program that will print out a list of food
trucks, given a source of food truck data from the San Francisco government’s API.

## Prerequisites

- Must have `node` in your machine

## How to Run

```
$ node FoodTruckFinder.js
```

This will display all the open food trucks alphabetically and you might want to press any key to continue.

## Future Improvement

I would like to update this command line application to a fully featured web application. It will be very helpful for users who don’t have any technical skills to run by themself. Web applications could be very interactive and we could add images or menus related to their own business. We can have a button to sort the food trucks by distance or something. We could also use a database to store the food trucks information so that we don’t have to look up their name and location every time. We can just regularly update the database if there’s something that we should change or modify. Plus, we should add a map using Google Map API to indicate all the food trucks locations rather than just showing them an address. In conclusion, making a web application instead of a command line application would be much more powerful and easy to use.
